# Rock, Paper, Scissors in RISC-V Assembly

This is a project developed for my **Organization and Architecture of Computers** class in college. I created a **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game in **Assembly RISC-V** and implemented **linked lists** to store all the computer's plays against the player.

## How to Run

To run the project, you need to download and use **RARS (RISC-V Assembler and Runtime Simulator)**:

1. Download RARS from the [official repository](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars).
2. Open the RARS application.
3. Load the game file into RARS.
4. Assemble and run the code to play the game.

## Features

- **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**: Play against the computer in this classic game.
- **Linked List Implementation**: Keeps a record of all the computer's plays during the session.
- **Assembly RISC-V**: The entire game and data structure were written in low-level RISC-V Assembly language.

## Technologies Used

- **RISC-V Assembly**: The game logic and linked list are implemented entirely in RISC-V Assembly.
- **RARS Simulator**: Used for assembling and running the program.

## Purpose

This project was made as part of a college assignment to deepen my understanding of:

- Assembly language programming
- Data structure implementation in low-level environments
- Computer architecture concepts
